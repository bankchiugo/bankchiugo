👩‍💻 Meet me... Bank is an economics graduate with a love for numbers, a curiosity for tech, and a dream of turning data into magic. Once upon a time, I wanted to work in an oil company—because why not mix childhood dreams with a name like Bank?

Passionate about making a difference, Bank also dreams of tackling homelessness and poverty in Nigeria—because changing the world sounds like a fun challenge. When I'm not crunching numbers, I am reading novels, watching motivational movies, and wondering if my next big idea will make me the Elon Musk of techology and welfare economics.
